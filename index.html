        <p>I am currently a PhotoPass Photographer at Walt Disney World. I am looking to make my way in the corporate world.
            I have experience in html, css, javascript, Microsoft Office, and many skills that come with this experience.
            I have been a guest service representative for 8 years in a variety of different fields in addition to my current
            role in Disney Photo Imaging. I have been a cashier/usher for Regal Cinemas, a Book Seller for Barnes And Noble,
            a Sandwich Artist for Subway, a Dietary Aide at the Sycammore Retirement Home in Nashville, and I worked in Quick
            Service Food and Beverage at All Star Movies for my Disney College Program. I graduated from that program after
            I received my second Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. If you click the start button you will see some of the companies I have worked for as well as important skills I will bring to the work place.</p>
